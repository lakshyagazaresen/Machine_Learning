Tutorial for Machine Learning

####This is for learning purpose######

I have created this repository for practice purpose as I am training myself in Machine Learning models.
I have taken few small datasets and have applied Regression, Classification and Clustering Models.

The aim is to apply all the common Machine Learning techniques known in the industry on small datasets and learn how to interpret their accuracy.
The aim is to also understand when to apply which Machine Learning model to obtain maximum accuracy and precision.
